\section{My first section}
This is my document.  There isn't much to it.

\subsection{A subsection for fun}
This is the second paragraph of my document.  This
paragraph is longer than the first paragraph because
I kept typing words in this paragraph, and didn't
type as many words in the preceding paragraph.

\section{My very short third section}
This is my third paragraph, the shortest yet.

However, this section has a table and a figure.

 \begin{table}
 \begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}
 Degrees Granted for Academic Year 2011-12 & Bachelors & Masters & Doctoral \\ \hline
 Degrees Granted                           &    1,348  &  1,093  &    258   \\
 \% Women                                  &      21\% &    21\% &    21\%  \\
 \% URM                                    &       7\% &     8\% &    14\%  \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
