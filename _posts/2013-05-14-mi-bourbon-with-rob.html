Rob and his family came over tonight with a daughter who needed her
ankle looked at by an orthopaedic surgeon (not me) and bottle of
Michigan-made bourbon (much more me)
</p>
<p>
He brought Traverse City Whiskey Co. Bourbon to compare to my bottle
of Michigan-made bourbon&mdash;New Holland Artisan Spirits Beer Barrel
Bourbon.

We tried the New Holland Bourbon first.  It had a pleasant sweetness
but a moderately sharp alcohol bite at first.
</p>
<p>
The Traverse City Whiskey Co. Bourbon was much less sweet and much
less sharp than the New Holland.  It wasn't as complex, but was very
easy to drink.

Rob has a history of "blind taste tests of alcoholic drinks", so we
thought we'd try a simple version.  I went into the living room and
he poured me a glass of one of the two.  With a 50/50 chance, I tried
to taste for either the bite and sweetness of the New Holland or the
smoothness of the Traverse City.  I was successful in my guess that
he poured me the New Holland.
