<p>
In 90 minutes in the Johnson Rooms we'll go over how to install
LaTeX on computers running Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, and
Ubuntu Linux, then how to write a simple document and produce a PDF
file, how to add a title, author, table of contents, equations, and
graphics.  The last third of the time will be spent answering
specific questions about LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
If you have experience with LaTeX, the early part of the talk isn't
likely to be useful to you, but the later parts might be.
</p>

<p>
You should bring a laptop, as this will be a hands-on discussion.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Writing a Simple Document</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
To test your LaTeX installation, you should create a simple
document.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Contents of a simple LaTeX document</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
The contents of a very simple LaTeX document are:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-latex">\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
This is my document.  There isn't much to it.

This is the second paragraph of my document.  This paragraph is longer
than the first paragraph because I kept typing words in this paragraph,
and didn't type as many words in the preceding paragraph.

This is my third paragraph, the shortest yet.

\end{document}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The first line, <code>\documentclass{article}</code>, is the most common type of
document you'll write in LaTeX&#x2014;the other common options are
<code>letter</code> for letter that you would mail to someone and <code>book</code>,
which adds the option of chapters to your document.  For anything
beyond <code>article</code> you will probably want to consider packages other
than <code>letter</code> and <code>book</code>.
</p>

<p>
The second and last lines, <code>\begin{document}</code> and <code>\end{document}</code>
bound your document&#x2014;you always have to have these two lines and
nearly all of your content will be between those two lines.
</p>

<p>
Between the <code>\begin</code> and <code>\end</code> lines is the content for your
document.  In this example it is three paragraphs.  A paragraph is
created by leaving a blank line.  You don't have to wrap the lines
yourself, they will be processed by LaTeX when you process your
document.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Typing the document</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
A LaTeX document is simply a text file&#x2014;this is one of the
beauties of LaTeX: you'll always be able to read the text file.
</p>

<p>
If you are familiar with a text editor for programming, such as
<code>emacs</code> or <code>vi</code>, you can use that editor to write LaTeX
documents.  If you prefer a more integrated environment for
typing your documents, MacTeX comes with TeXworks and TeXshop,
MikTeX comes with TeXworks, and on Ubuntu there are TeXmaker,
Kile, <a href="http://gummi.midnightcoding.org/">Gummi</a>, and many others.
</p>

<p>
After opening your editor, you should be able to paste in the
sample document above, or start writing your own short document
between the <code>\begin{document}</code> and <code>\end{document}</code> lines.
</p>

<p>
Save the file as <code>sample.tex</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">Processing the document</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
When you are done writing, you can process the document to a PDF
file and see what you've created.
</p>

<p>
If you have a <code>.tex</code> file, you can process it from the command
line in the Windows <code>command</code> shell, the Mac <code>Terminal</code>, or a
Linux <code>xterm</code> by typing:
</p>
<pre class="example">
pdflatex sample.tex
</pre>
<p>
and you should see several lines of output, the first few and last
few should be something like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.4-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2012)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
entering extended mode
(./sample.tex
   [... many more lines ...]
LaTeX2e &lt;2011/06/27&gt;
Output written on sample.pdf (1 page, 16198 bytes).
Transcript written on sample.log.
</pre>

<p>
The LaTeX editors will have a menu item or button that will do the
processing for you.
</p>

<p>
If there is an error, it isn't always easy to decode, but some of
the editors will try to set the cursor at the point of the error.
Otherwise, carefully read the error and check your <code>.tex</code> file for
missing brackets, a <code>\begin</code> without its matching <code>\end</code>, and
other typos.
</p>

<p>
Once you are able to successfully process <code>sample.tex</code> into
<code>sample.pdf</code> and open <code>sample.pdf</code> and see it, we can start adding
to the document.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Adding to the document</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Once we have a simple document, we can start adding more
interesting parts to it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1">Title and Author</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Adding a title and author or authors to your document is
straightforward.
</p>

<p>
Between the <code>\documentclass</code> and <code>\begin{document}</code> lines, you
should add:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\title{My Sample Document}
\author{Type Your Name Here}
</pre>
<p>
and immediately after the <code>\begin{document}</code> line add the line:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\maketitle
</pre>

<p>
After processing the updated <code>.tex</code> file, you will see a title,
author, and today's date added to the top of your PDF file.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-2">Sections and subsections</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
LaTeX supports numbering sections, subsections, and subsubsections
by simply adding a line that reads <code>\section{My Section Title}</code> (or
<code>\subsection{My subsection Title}</code> or <code>\subsubsection{My
   subsubsection Title}</code>) before the section.
</p>

<p>
Editing <code>sample.tex</code> and adding <code>\section</code> before the first and
third paragraphs and <code>\subsection</code> before the second paragraph
brings us to a source document that looks like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-latex">\documentclass{article}
\title{My Sample Document}
\author{Type Your Name Here}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{My first section}
This is my document.  There isn't much to it.

\subsection{A subsection for fun}
This is the second paragraph of my document.  This paragraph is longer
than the first paragraph because I kept typing words in this paragraph,
and didn't type as many words in the preceding paragraph.

\section{My very short third section}
This is my third paragraph, the shortest yet.

\end{document}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Processing that file, assuming I didn't make any errors and you
didn't introduce any in its transcription, should result in a
document with a title, author, date, and two sections, one with a
subsection.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-3">Equations and Tables</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">

<h4 id="sec-5-3-1">Equations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-1">
<p>
There are two types of basic equations in LaTeX: equations that
are part of the text, in-line math, and equations that are offset
from the text and numbered.
</p>

<p>
Equations are written in text and the keyboard math symbols.
Pythagoras might have written:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
</pre>
<p>
to get
</p>
<div class="equation">
<p>
\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)
</p>

</div>

<p>
Another example is the equation for the area of a circle:
</p>
<pre class="example">
A = \pi r^2
</pre>
<p>
to get
</p>
<div class="equation">
<p>
\(A = \pi r^2\)
</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-5-3-2">Tables</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-2">
<p>
Tables in LaTeX comprise five items that describe a table:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <code>\begin{table}</code> and matching <code>\end{table}</code> surrounding the
tablular environment
</li>
<li>a <code>\begin{tabular}{&lt;tableadvice&gt;}</code> and matching
       <code>\end{tabular}</code> around the table data
</li>
<li>the <code>&lt;tableadvice&gt;</code> which describes the alignment and vertical
lines in the table using <code>|</code> to describe vertical lines and
letters (<code>l</code>,=c=,=r=) to describe alignment
</li>
<li>the <code>&amp;</code> character to define columns <code>\\</code> to define rows, and
       <code>\hline</code> to draw horizontal lines
</li>
<li>the caption for the table, using <code>\caption{My Caption}</code> after
the <code>tabular</code> environment and before the end of the <code>table</code>
environment.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Taking the <b>Degrees Granted for Academic Year 2011-12</b> table from
<a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/about/facts">http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/about/facts</a> we could represent
that table in LaTeX as:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}
Degrees Granted for Academic Year 2011-12 &amp; Bachelors &amp; Masters &amp; Doctoral \\ \hline
Degrees Granted                           &amp;    1,348  &amp;  1,093  &amp;    258   \\
\% Women                                  &amp;      21\% &amp;    21\% &amp;    21\%  \\
\% URM                                    &amp;       7\% &amp;     8\% &amp;    14\%  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Engineering Degrees Granted for Academic Year 2011-12}
\end{table}
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>|</code> characters in the <code>tabular</code> line instruct LaTeX to put
vertical lines between the columns, but not on the left or
right ends.
</li>
<li>The <code>\hline</code> commands at the ends of the lines instruct LaTeX
to put a horizontal line below the current line.
</li>
<li>The <code>\%</code> is required because <code>%</code> is a special character in
LaTeX that denotes a comment from it to the end of the line;
that's very useful in many cases, but not when you mean
percentage.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This all produces a table that looks like:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
While it is possible to create images in LaTeX directly using it's
native but limited <code>picture</code> environment or the somewhat
complicated <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/">Tikz</a> package, it is most common to create images in
another package&#x2014;=gnuplot= or R for plots, Adobe Illustrator or
another drawing package for diagrams.
</p>

<p>
For this example, we'll make a plot using the statistical package
R and write the plot to a file called <code>mpg-weight.png</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-R">library(ggplot2)
mtcars$gear &lt;- factor(mtcars$gear,levels=c(3,4,5), labels=c("3gears","4gears","5gears"))
mtcars$am   &lt;- factor(mtcars$am,levels=c(0,1), labels=c("Automatic","Manual"))
mtcars$cyl  &lt;- factor(mtcars$cyl,levels=c(4,6,8), labels=c("4cyl","6cyl","8cyl"))

qplot(wt, mpg, data=mtcars, geom=c("point", "smooth"),
     method="lm", formula=y~x, color=cyl,
     main="Regression of MPG on Weight",
     xlab="Weight", ylab="Miles per Gallon")
</pre>
</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/mpg-weight.png"  alt="mpg-weight.png"/></p>
<p>Weight vs. MPG</p>
</div>


<p>
This file is included in the LaTeX output by adding the line:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\include{graphicx}
</pre>
<p>
immediately after the <code>\documentclass{article}</code> line in your
<code>.tex</code> file and then including the lines:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{mpg-weight.png}
\caption{Weight vs. MPG}
\end{figure}
</pre>
<p>
The full path to <code>mpg-weight.png</code> should be specified in the
<code>\includegraphics</code> line; in this example LaTeX will assume that
the image file is in the same directory as the <code>.tex</code> file.
</p>

<p>
You can download this image for using when processing <code>sample.tex</code>
by right-clicking on it and saving it to the same folder as
<code>sample.tex</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>graphicx</code> package combined with <code>pdflatex</code> can read PDF, PNG,
JPEG, and MetaPost graphic formats.  Other formats should be
converted to one of these for inclusion.  If you can export
directly to PDF, that is ideal.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-5">Tables of Contents, Tables, and Figures</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-5">
<p>
Adding tables of contents, tables, and figures to the front matter
of your document is straight-forward.
</p>

<p>
To add a table of contents, add the line <code>\tableofcontents</code> after
your <code>\maketitle</code> line to generate a table of contents.  Because
LaTeX is a single-pass processor, it stores some of its
information in auxilliary files; this means that you may have to
run <code>pdflatex</code> more than once to get all of the references
resolved.
</p>

<p>
To add a list of figures, insert the line <code>\listoffigures</code> after
the <code>\maketitle</code> or <code>\tableofcontents</code> lines in your <code>.tex</code> file.
</p>

<p>
Our current <code>sample.tex</code> file now looks like:
</p>
