On Wednesday, August 7, 2013 I'm going to give a quick introduction
to LaTeX.  I'll be in the Johnson Rooms in the Lurie Building from
12:00p&#x2013;1:30pm.

<p>
I'll be updating this blog entry in the coming weeks; please check
back for updates, instructions, and notes.

<p>
In 90 minutes in the Johnson Rooms we'll go over how to install
LaTeX on computers running Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, and
Ubuntu Linux, then how to write a simple document and produce a PDF
file, how to add a title, author, table of contents, equations, and
graphics.  The last third of the time will be spent answering
specific questions about LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
If you have experience with LaTeX, the early part of the talk isn't
likely to be useful to you, but the later parts might be.
</p>

<p>
You should bring a laptop, as this will be a hands-on discussion.

Before coming to class, please install LaTeX on your laptop and
download a copy of <a href="http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort-letter.pdf"><i>A Not-so-short Introduction to LaTeX</i></a> and bring
an electronic or printed copy.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Writing a Simple Document</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
To test your LaTeX installation, you should create a simple
document.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Contents of a simple LaTeX document</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
The contents of a very simple LaTeX document are:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-latex">\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
This is my document.  There isn't much to it.

This is the second paragraph of my document.  This paragraph is longer
than the first paragraph because I kept typing words in this paragraph,
and didn't type as many words in the preceding paragraph.

This is my third paragraph, the shortest yet.

\end{document}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The first line, <code>\documentclass{article}</code>, is the most common type of
document you'll write in LaTeX&#x2014;the other common options are
<code>letter</code> for letter that you would mail to someone and <code>book</code>,
which adds the option of chapters to your document.  For anything
beyond <code>article</code> you will probably want to consider packages other
than <code>letter</code> and <code>book</code>.
</p>

<p>
The second and last lines, <code>\begin{document}</code> and <code>\end{document}</code>
bound your document&#x2014;you always have to have these two lines and
nearly all of your content will be between those two lines.
</p>

<p>
Between the <code>\begin</code> and <code>\end</code> lines is the content for your
document.  In this example it is three paragraphs.  A paragraph is
created by leaving a blank line.  You don't have to wrap the lines
yourself, they will be processed by LaTeX when you process your
document.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Typing the document</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
A LaTeX document is simply a text file&#x2014;this is one of the
beauties of LaTeX: you'll always be able to read the text file.
</p>

<p>
If you are familiar with a text editor for programming, such as
<code>emacs</code> or <code>vi</code>, you can use that editor to write LaTeX
documents.  If you prefer a more integrated environment for
typing your documents, MacTeX comes with TeXworks and TeXshop,
MikTeX comes with TeXworks, and on Ubuntu there are TeXmaker,
Kile, <a href="http://gummi.midnightcoding.org/">Gummi</a>, and many others.
</p>

<p>
After opening your editor, you should be able to paste in the
sample document above, or start writing your own short document
between the <code>\begin{document}</code> and <code>\end{document}</code> lines.
</p>

<p>
Save the file as <code>sample.tex</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">Processing the document</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
When you are done writing, you can process the document to a PDF
file and see what you've created.
</p>

<p>
If you have a <code>.tex</code> file, you can process it from the command
line in the Windows <code>command</code> shell, the Mac <code>Terminal</code>, or a
Linux <code>xterm</code> by typing:
</p>
<pre class="example">
pdflatex sample.tex
</pre>
<p>
and you should see several lines of output, the first few and last
few should be something like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.4-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2012)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
entering extended mode
(./sample.tex
   [... many more lines ...]
LaTeX2e &lt;2011/06/27&gt;
Output written on sample.pdf (1 page, 16198 bytes).
Transcript written on sample.log.
</pre>

<p>
The LaTeX editors will have a menu item or button that will do the
processing for you.
</p>

<p>
If there is an error, it isn't always easy to decode, but some of
the editors will try to set the cursor at the point of the error.
Otherwise, carefully read the error and check your <code>.tex</code> file for
missing brackets, a <code>\begin</code> without its matching <code>\end</code>, and
other typos.
</p>

<p>
Once you are able to successfully process <code>sample.tex</code> into
<code>sample.pdf</code> and open <code>sample.pdf</code> and see it, we can start adding
to the document.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Adding to the document</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Once we have a simple document, we can start adding more
interesting parts to it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1">Title and Author</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Adding a title and author or authors to your document is
straightforward.
</p>

<p>
Between the <code>\documentclass</code> and <code>\begin{document}</code> lines, you
should add:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\title{My Sample Document}
\author{Type Your Name Here}
</pre>
<p>
and immediately after the <code>\begin{document}</code> line add the line:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\maketitle
</pre>

<p>
After processing the updated <code>.tex</code> file, you will see a title,
author, and today's date added to the top of your PDF file.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-2">Sections and subsections</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
LaTeX supports numbering sections, subsections, and subsubsections
by simply adding a line that reads <code>\section{My Section Title}</code> (or
<code>\subsection{My subsection Title}</code> or <code>\subsubsection{My
   subsubsection Title}</code>) before the section.
</p>

<p>
Editing <code>sample.tex</code> and adding <code>\section</code> before the first and
third paragraphs and <code>\subsection</code> before the second paragraph
brings us to a source document that looks like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-latex">\documentclass{article}
\title{My Sample Document}
\author{Type Your Name Here}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{My first section}
This is my document.  There isn't much to it.

\subsection{A subsection for fun}
This is the second paragraph of my document.  This paragraph is longer
than the first paragraph because I kept typing words in this paragraph,
and didn't type as many words in the preceding paragraph.

\section{My very short third section}
This is my third paragraph, the shortest yet.

\end{document}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Processing that file, assuming I didn't make any errors and you
didn't introduce any in its transcription, should result in a
document with a title, author, date, and two sections, one with a
subsection.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-3">Equations and Tables</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
There are two types of basic equations in LaTeX: equations that
are part of the text, in-line math, and equations that are offset
from the text and numbered.
</p>

<p>
Equations are written in text and the keyboard math symbols.
Pythagoras might have written:
</p>
<pre class="example">
\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}
</pre>
<p>
to get
</p>
<div class="equation">
<p>
\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)
</p>

</div>

<p>
Another example is the equation for the area of a circle:
</p>
<pre class="example">
A = \pi r^2
</pre>
<p>
to get
</p>
<div class="equation">
<p>
\(A = \pi r^2\)
</p>

</div>
</div>
