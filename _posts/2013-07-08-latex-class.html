On Wednesday, August 7, 2013 I'm going to give a quick introduction
to LaTeX.  I'll be in the Johnson Rooms in the Lurie Building from
12:00p&#x2013;1:30pm.
</p>

<p>
I'll be updating this blog entry in the coming weeks; please check
back for updates, instructions, and notes.

<p>
In 90 minutes in the Johnson Rooms we'll go over how to install
LaTeX on computers running Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, and
Ubuntu Linux, then how to write a simple document and produce a PDF
file, how to add a title, author, table of contents, equations, and
graphics.  The last third of the time will be spent answering
specific questions about LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
If you have experience with LaTeX, the early part of the talk isn't
likely to be useful to you, but the later parts might.
