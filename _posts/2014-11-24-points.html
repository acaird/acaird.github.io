<p>
I am a sucker for rewards points, the marketing people totally have my
number.  And, for the really good ones, I don&rsquo;t even mind.
</p>

<p>
Lots of things I use have points systems: <a href="http://www.moosejaw.com">Moosejaw</a> for outerwear,
<a href="http://www.delta.com">Delta</a> for travel (although Delta calls them miles and makes them
impossible to actually use), <a href="http://www.zingermans.com">Zingerman</a>&rsquo;s for mail-order food, and
<a href="http://www.americanexpress.com">American Express</a> for buying all sorts of stuff.
</p>

<p>
I always forget about my Moosejaw points, can never figure out how to
use my Delta points, and Zingerman&rsquo;s takes care of my points for me by
occasionally sending me a gift card.  In that pool, Zingerman&rsquo;s wins,
because I don&rsquo;t have to do anything other than give them lots of money
in exchange for excellent gifts for friends.
</p>

<p>
The one that tops them all, though, is American Express.  We spend
enough on our AmEx that we accrue points at a rate that keeps me
engaged in buying things from their Rewards Points store.  For a while
all I was buying were Bowers &amp; Wilkens <a href="http://www.bowers-wilkins.com/Wireless-Speakers/AirPlay-Speakers/A5">A5</a> speakers, until I was
forbidden from buying any more (by then, though, I had enough for all
of the rooms I wanted them in).  Then for a while I was using points
to pay parts of the monthly bill&#x2014;that turns out to be <b>totally
boring</b> so I stopped doing that.  So points started accruing again and
pretty soon I had enough to make things interesting&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Detour&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Lately I&rsquo;ve been using in-ear <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shure-SE115m-Sound-Isolating-Headset/dp/B0031RG33C/">Shure SE115m+</a> ear-buds more and more at
home (by the way, flying without these is torture&#x2014;these are the
perfect airplane ear-buds), and <a href="http://thestatusaudio.com/collections/headphones/products/classic-1">Status Classic</a> headphones more and
more at work and I&rsquo;ve noticed that people leave me alone more when I&rsquo;m
wearing the bigger headphones, so another pair of headphones was in
order.
</p>

<p>
All headphone research starts out at looking at headphones in the
$50&#x2013;$100 range and escalates in about 0.5s to &ldquo;monitors&rdquo; in the
multiple hundreds of dollars range and then starts to involve
multi-hundred dollar <a href="http://schiit.com/products/valhalla-2">headphone tube amps</a> on top, then I get bummed and
stop.
</p>

<p>
<i>This time things were different&#x2026; because of POINTS!</i>
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; end of detour.
</p>

<p>
Now I have three facts in hand
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have gobs of AmEx points
</li>
<li>AmEx sells Bowers &amp; Wilkens stuff
</li>
<li>I want the B&amp;W P7 headphones (well, <i>need</i>, really)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So anyhow, some new headphones are on their way.
