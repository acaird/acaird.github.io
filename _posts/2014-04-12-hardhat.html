This is me in a hardhat.

This has more to do with computing than you might think.

I am cleaning out my office, in a commitment to minimalism.  A lot
of my strive for minimalism was brought about by cloud-based
service; if I can't do it in <a href="http://www.orgmode.org">Emacs Org Mode</a> and put it in GitHub or
do it in a Google doc, I don't want to do it; if I can, all of that
is in the cloud and my very expensive, but very nice, MacBook Air is
just a cloud access device.  All of that is a different blog post.
I am cleaning out my office.  I found this hardhat that I've been
keeping for years. I put it on to wear to get rid of it when I ran
into one of my excellent co-workers, Delisa, and she asked why I had
a hardhat.

<h2 id="sec-2">The story of the hardhat</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
In the olden days of of the mid-1990s I worked at <a href="http://caen.engin.umich.edu/">CAEN</a> (oh, wait, I
also work there now) as the only student employee of the only
full-time employee (Paul McClay) who was reponsible for the
high-performance computing environment.  Paul went back to school to
study <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">Information</a>, and I became the only full-time employee (at
which point I hired the excellent <code>rebshol</code> (Becky Hollenbeck), but
the excellence of <code>rebshol</code> and U-M Engineering students in general
is also another blog post).
</p>

<p>
High-performance Computing systems have always placed extraordinay
demands on the data centers in which they are housed.  Even in the
mid-1990s.  However, U-M were building a new building, the
Integrated Technology Information Center (ITIC), with a very nice
modern data center.  And we had a big computer that needed a nice
modern data center, a 32-node <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Scalable_POWERparallel">IBM SP2</a> (yes, at the time that was
big).  As with all things, it was <i>critical</i> and <i>urgent</i> that we
move this computer out of its current data center.  So we moved it
into ITIC.  Along with it, my office moved, making me the first
denizen of the building.
</p>

<p>
Hey, when does the hardhat come in?  Is this just a story of the
move of some ancient computer?
</p>

<p>
The building wasn't done.  The data center was done, some offices
were done, but the building wasn't.  I wasn't allowed in to my
office or to work on the computer because it was a construction site
with no Certificate of Occupancy.  The computer needed a lot of
work.  I needed to get to it.
</p>

<p>
After some negotiation about a scrawny kid who was clearly not a
construction worker, I was allowed to go to my office, but only if I
wore a hardhat to and from.  I felt quite like a bad-ass doing
that.  I wasn't, but that's beside the point.  I had a hardhat.
Wicked.
</p>

<p>
A few months later the building was done, a bunch of other people
moved in, and I didn't need to wear a hardhat to work any longer.
Things were more boring.

<h2 id="sec-3">Getting rid of the hardhat</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
This is the true story I told to Delisa, who then said I couldn't
get rid of the hat, because it was a good prop for a good story.
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping that this documentation will be enough so that she will
see her way clear to give me permission to retire the hat.
</p>

<p>
Minimalism vs. Memories.
</p>

<p>
This is why people keep things: fear of forgetting.  A white piece
of plastic will bring those interesting old days to mind every time
I see it.  I'm still young enough to be confident there are more
interesting days coming, so I'm OK with moving on, but only OK, not
certain.  That is why minimalism is scary.

ITIC had its name changed before it was completed to the University
of Michigan Media Union (UMMU), because it is a place that was
supposed to bring together all sorts of media.  Some years later,
Dr. James Duderstadt (go Nuclear Engineers!!) and his wife Anne made
a donation to the University which changed the name of that building
to the Duderstadt Center.  Many people now call it <i>The Dude</i>.  And
almost two decades and many jobs later, I do not need to wear a
hardhat to work, although some days it seems like I should.v

Delisa agreed that I've met my duty to memory, and could get rid of
the hat:

Awesome!  I think it is now safe to get rid of the hat. :-)<br  />
