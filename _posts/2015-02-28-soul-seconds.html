People measure time in lots of ways, mostly seconds that tick by on
the clock, but there are other ways, and I think we should measure
more things in <i>soul-seconds</i>&#x2014;the number of seconds of joy something
brings you in the future for what you did in the past.

The other day I received an email with three Microsoft Excel files
attached; each file was formatted to look like a calendar, with a row
of cells for dates in the week, then the following cells containing
events, one per cell.  It looks sort of like this:

That format isn&rsquo;t helpful, because it isn&rsquo;t a calendar.  I&rsquo;m not
sure why the people who make the calendar don&rsquo;t use Outlook, or
Google Calendar, or something else that would be, for them, a
calendar.  I assume they maintain two copies, and email me the worse
of the two.
</p>

<p>
Of all of the items on each monthly calendar, I care about 8 of
them.  Manually transcribing them onto my Google calendar takes
about (at most) a minute each, so that&rsquo;s 24 minutes of effort every
quarter, which is, approximately, 0 minutes in the grand scheme of
life.
</p>

<p>
All of that is measured in &ldquo;wall clock&rdquo; time, or time that ticks by
on a clock on the wall.
</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;soul time&rdquo;, it is something like 50 hours.  It&rsquo;s awful.  It&rsquo;s
drudgery for no reason.  It&rsquo;s error prone.  It has no redeeming
value.  I couldn&rsquo;t dislike it more.  I dislike it so much that some
quarters I don&rsquo;t do it, then I spend three months being shocked when
those events roll around, and annoyed when they conflict with
something else I&rsquo;ve scheduled.  The whole process is the worst.
</p>

<p>
Wall clock: 24 minutes.  Soul clock: 50 hours.   You see the
problem.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Investing in soul clock time</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
To solve the pain of my 24-minutes-per-three-month problem, I spend
6 hours writing a <a href="https://github.com/acaird/call-sched-parser">computer program</a> to read the Excel file and give
me back an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">ICS</a> file that I can import into Google calendar (or
Apple&rsquo;s iCal, or Microsoft&rsquo;s Outlook, or lots of other calendar
programs, but not other spreadsheet programs, because the data isn&rsquo;t
fucking spreadsheet data).
</p>

<p>
At the end of my project, I was able to put the information from the
Excel files into my calendar in a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
However, it took me six hours.  That is about 12 quarters of doing
this manually (30 minutes per quarter goes into 6 hours 12 times).
That&rsquo;s 3 years.  There is no way that was worth the time
investment.
</p>

<p>
My soul time estimate for doing it manually was 50 hours per
quarter; in that case, my six hours was a great investment.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s all about perspective, and the clock on the wall shouldn&rsquo;t be
your only perspective.

Some people say that automation doesn&rsquo;t save you time
<a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png" alt="automation.png" /></a>
and that can be true (clearly not in most cases, or the foundations
of the industrial revolution are in significant peril), but it is
important for you (and other humans) to factor in the pay-off from
the investment of soul-time, not just the investment of wall-clock
time.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> What is soul time?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Soul time is what you spend to make yourself happy in an on-going,
or future-looking, way.  Like anything you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;waste&rdquo; time on,
it&rsquo;s an investment in the future.  Soul time&rsquo;s investment, though,
isn&rsquo;t the same as wall-clock time; often it looks like a bad
investment when compared to a clock on the wall, but it makes you
happy.  It cases where it looks like a bad investment with respect
to wall-clock time, you will get accused of &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; time, which is
too bad, because who ever accuses you of that doesn&rsquo;t understand: a)
that not all investments pay off the same way and b) what makes you
happy.  Because those people don&rsquo;t understand that, you are safe to
ignore them (just be sure it&rsquo;s <i>your</i> wall-clock time you are
investing; if it is your employer&rsquo;s, that decision isn&rsquo;t up to you).
</p>

<p>
If you can find a task (or job, or hobby, or whatever) that has a
ratio of soul time to wall-clock time that is 1 or less, guard that
with everything you have, for you have won: you are spending less
wall-clock time than soul-time, and thus coming out ahead on
soul-time while not spending (or, in some people&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;wasting&rdquo;
time).

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Balance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Some things just take time and are no fun and somethings are fun but
not an investment in the future; both of those things are necessary
and part of life.  One step to being happy is maximizing that slice
in the middle that is both: the balance between soul time and
wall-clock time.
</p>

<p>
And good luck getting to:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\frac{soul time}{wall-clock time} \leq 1
\end{equation}
