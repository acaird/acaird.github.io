<p>
Using a force sensitive resistor with a Raspberry Pi isn&rsquo;t terribly
complicated, but I didn&rsquo;t see it documented elsewhere on the Internet,
so here are my notes.

Assuming you have a <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/category/105">Raspberry Pi</a> and the desire to measure the
existence of some pressure, this is what else you&rsquo;ll need:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2029">Pi Cobbler</a> that will let you attach the Pi to a breadboard with
a <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1988">ribbon cable</a>
</li>

<li>a <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/239">breadboard</a> so you can plug everything in
</li>

<li>a <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/166">force sensitive resistor</a> (really, without this you can skip the
rest of this blog post)
</li>

<li>a MCP3008 <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/856">analog to digital converter</a> to convert the analog signals from
the FSR to digital signals that the Raspberry Pi can read

<p>
You can get a different ADC, but then these instructions will need
some interpretation.
</p>
</li>

<li>some <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/758">wires</a> to make connections on the breadboard
</li>

<li>a <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/10k-ohm-1-4-watt-carbon-film-resistor-5-pack/2711335.html">10k Ohm</a> resistor
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I&rsquo;ve linked these to AdaFruit and RadioShack, but that&rsquo;s just
because that&rsquo;s what Google told me first, and that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve
ordered most of my components; I have no affiliation with either of
them.

<p>
Most of the wiring information I got was from AdaFruit&rsquo;s
instructions at <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi/connecting-the-cobbler-to-a-mcp3008">Reading a Analog Input&#x2026;</a>, which I&rsquo;ll gratefully
paraphrase here.
</p>

<p>
First, attach the Pi Cobbler and th MCP3008 to the breadboard along
the center (see the diagram below).
</p>

<p>
Next, wire the Pi Cobbler to the MCP3008 following these
instructions:
</p>


<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
On the same unused location on the breadboard where Channel 0 is
connected, connect one of the leads from the FSR and connect that
same row on the breadboard to ground using the 10kOhm resistor.  If
you leave this &ldquo;pull-down resistor&rdquo; out, the readings from the FSR
will just flap all around and be useless (at least, so says a friend
of mine who did that; you wouldn&rsquo;t know him).  Attach the other lead
of the FSR to the power rail (a resistor without a current isn&rsquo;t
much good).
</p>

<p>
Finally, attach the <code>3v3</code> from the Pi Cobbler to the power rail of
the breadboard to deliver power to everything.
</p>

<p>
The end result should look something like this:
</p>

Again, most of the script I use for this came from AdaFruit,
specifically from the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi/script">Python script page</a> in the instructions for
<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi/connecting-the-cobbler-to-a-mcp3008">Reading a Analog Input&#x2026;</a> that I mentioned above, although I did
make some changes.  My script is available at
<a href="https://github.com/acaird/raspi-scale">https://github.com/acaird/raspi-scale</a>.
</p>

<p>
Running that script just prints out values between 0 and 1023,
depending on how hard you squeeze the FSR.  What you do with that
data is up to you now.  I plan to <a href="https://github.com/acaird/raspi-scale/blob/master/README.org">monitor my can of coffee beans</a>,
but you&rsquo;ll have to check back later for the rest of that.
