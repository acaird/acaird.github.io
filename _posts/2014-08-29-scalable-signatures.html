<p>
Many people include an image of their signature in electronic
documents to make them look traditional, and because putting a PGP
signature block in a PDF file would be weird and not really that
useful.  Most of these images don't look much like signatures&#x2014;they
are bitmaps that don't scale well and look blocky and not really like
a signature at all.  We can do better.

<h2 id="sec-1">The Bitmap to Vector Miracle called <code>potrace</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
A while ago <a href="https://github.com/trozamon">Alec Ten Harmsel</a> and I were talking about how cool it
would be if you could take a bitmap (a PNG or JPG file) and convert
it into a vector file (SVG or PostScript or PDF), and also how hard
it would be do to that.  A little Google'ing turned up a program
that magically does this.
</p>

<p>
Peter Selinger's <a href="http://potrace.sourceforge.net">potrace</a> (<i>polygon trace</i>) takes a bitmap (a file in
PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP format), applies a lot of <a href="http://potrace.sourceforge.net/potrace.pdf">math</a>, and writes out
a file in one of several formats (the most useful of which, for our
purposes, are Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) and PDF).
</p>

<p>
You will need to <a href="http://potrace.sourceforge.net/#downloading">download potrace</a> (and maybe some other tools) to
follow along, but the results will be worth it.  If you are using an
Apple computer running OS X, you can use Mac Ports or Brew to
install <code>potrace</code> and its dependancies.

<h2 id="sec-2">Making an image file of your signature</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
There are three big steps to getting a scalable image file with your
signature in it.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get a digital copy of your signature.
</li>

<li>Convert the file to one of <code>potrace</code>'s input formats.
</li>

<li>Use <code>potrace</code> to make an EPS or PDF file of your signature.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Getting a digital copy of your signature</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
There are countless ways to do this, but the four easiest ways are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>sign your name in a drawing app on a tablet, and email yourself
the image file.
</li>
<li>draw your signature in a drawing program on your computer, and
save the image file.
</li>
<li>sign your name on a piece of plain white paper and take a photo
of it with your camera phone and email the photo to yourself.
If you choose this way, make sure your signature is as dark as
possible and the paper is a white as possible; put the paper by
a window or other bright light source to take the photo.
</li>
<li>sign your name on a piece of white paper, scan it with a
document scanner, and email it to yourself.  Even though the
scanner may send you a PDF, it isn't a scalable PDF, but a
bitmap wrapped in a PDF file.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
At the end of this process, you should have a file in PDF, JPG (or
JPEG), or PNG format that has your signature in it.
</p>

<p>
Once you have that file, you should crop it so that your signature
has a tight box around it.  On a Mac, you can do this using
Preview.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Converting the file to one of <code>potrace</code>'s input format</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
<code>potrace</code> takes a limited number of input formats (for the good
reason why, see the <code>potrace</code> FAQ list), so the next step is to
convert your signature file into one of them.  On a Mac, you can
use the appropriate command line tool:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />

<col  class="left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">If your file is</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">Convert it to</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">&#xa0;</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th scope="col" class="left">in this format</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">this format</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">By typing this</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">PNG</td>
<td class="left">PNM</td>
<td class="left"><code>pgntopnm file.png &gt; file.pnm</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">JPG / JPEG</td>
<td class="left">PNM</td>
<td class="left"><code>jpegtopnm file.jpg &gt; file.pnm</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">PDF</td>
<td class="left">PPM</td>
<td class="left"><code>pdftoppm file.pdf &gt; file.ppm</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
these tools are available on Macs via MacPorts or Brew, on Linux
via your preferred package manager, and probably also on Windows.
</p>

<p>
At the end of this step, you should have a PNM or PPM version of
the file with the image of your signature in it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Use <code>potrace</code> to get a PDF file</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
<code>potrace</code> is a command-line tool (although graphical interfaces are
available) that takes many parameters; the two that matter for our
purposes are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>-b pdf</code> to specify that the output is to be in PDF format
</li>
<li><code>-o signature.pdf</code> to specify that the output file is to be
called <code>signature.pdf</code>; you can change that to anything you
want
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The complete command, assuming you have a PNM file called
<code>signature.pnm</code> and you want your output file to be called
<code>signature.pdf</code> is:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">potrace -b pdf -o signature.pdf signature.pnm
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Results</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
You should now have a PDF file with a scalable version of your
signature in it.  If you open the original PNG file and the
resulting PDF file and zoom in on them, you should see a big
difference:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/sig-png-pdf-potrace.png" alt="sig-png-pdf-potrace.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> Comparing PNG input (top) and PDF output (bottom) files</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
</div><div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">All in one command line</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
The command below will skip the generation of the PNM file and go
straight from the PNG file to the PDF file.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">pngtopnm signature.png | potrace -b pdf -o signature.pdf
</pre>
</div>

<p>
On my system, this generates the warning
</p>
<pre class="example">
libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
</pre>
<p>
but that doesn't seem to have any effect on the output, so if you
see it, don't panic.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Using this signature in a LaTeX letter</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
If you are using a standard LaTeX letter format and pdflatex, you
should include the <code>graphicx</code> package and your signature line
should look like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-latex"><span style="color: #a020f0;">\signature</span>{<span style="color: #a020f0;">\vspace</span>{-3em}<span style="color: #a020f0;">\includegraphics</span>[width=10em]{<span style="color: #483d8b;">sig.pdf</span>}<span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">\\</span>Your Name}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
where <code>sig.pdf</code> is the PDF file containing the image of your
signature.  You may have to adjust the <code>vspace</code> and the <code>width</code>
depending on the size of your signature and how you want it to
look.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the NewLFM LaTeX package and pdflatex for your
letters, you also need the <code>graphicx</code> package and your signature
line looks the same as above, but without the negative <code>vspace</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-latex"><span style="color: #a020f0;">\signature</span>{<span style="color: #a020f0;">\includegraphics</span>[width=10em]{<span style="color: #483d8b;">sig.pdf</span>} <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">\\</span> Your Name}
