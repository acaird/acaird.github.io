<p>
There is some likelyhood that the combination of Salt and Vagrant will
be useful to me in the near future, so I started to experiment with
it, and it&rsquo;s all pretty nice.

This org-mode file exists on a pretend computer, called <i>minion</i>,
that is controlled by another pretend computer called <i>master</i>.
These two pretend computers are both running Linux.  The two
pretend computers are running on a real MacBook Air and are managed
by Vagrant.   The minion is controlled by the master via Salt.

There are literally billions of people in the world to whom the
previous paragraph makes no sense.

<li>Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>
</li>

<li>Install <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>
</li>

<li>Install <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">XCode</a>
</li>

<li>Follow the instructions at
<a href="https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest">https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest</a> to make sure your
VirtualBox guest additions match&#x2014;this is important to make the
directory that is shared with the guests (<i>master</i> and <i>minion</i>)
work with the host.  If you have XCode and some luck on your
side, the command:
<pre class="example">
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
</pre>
<p>
will do the trick.

</li>

<li>Follow the instructions at
<a href="http://humankeyboard.com/saltstack/2014/saltstack-virtualbox-vagrant.html">http://humankeyboard.com/saltstack/2014/saltstack-virtualbox-vagrant.html</a>
but add <code>sudo</code> where needed, because they aren&rsquo;t in the document
everywhere I expected them to be.
</li>

<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the bunch of Salt errors from the minion
provisioning, Salt still works.  What matters is that <code>test.ping</code>
works from the master:
<pre class="example">
You@Your-Computer$ vagrant ssh master
[...]
vagrant@master:~$ sudo salt minion test.ping
minion:
    True
</pre>
<p>
If you see that, Salt commands will work.  I think if you had a
state tree, you wouldn&rsquo;t see those errors, but I haven&rsquo;t tested
that yet.

Obviously, you want to install Emacs and Org-mode on the minion.  To
do that, create a file on the master called <code>/srv/salt/emacs.sls</code>
that contains:
</p>
<pre class="example">
emacs:
   pkg.installed
org-mode:
   pkg.installed
</pre>

<p>
Then type: <code>vagrant@master:~$ sudo salt minion state.sls emacs</code> and
wait.  When it&rsquo;s done, you&rsquo;ll get a report of all of the things that
were installed (there are a lot of them), but then you can log into
the minion and run the Proper Command.
</p>
<pre class="example">
You@Your-Computer$ vagrant ssh minion
[...]
vagrant@minion:~$ emacs -f org-mode
</pre>
<p>
and you&rsquo;ll be so happy.
