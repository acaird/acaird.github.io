<a href="http://www.2lwinery.com/">Two Lads Winery</a> is a Michigan winery that makes a very nice sparkling
Pinot Grigio, but, like many lads, it doesn't keep the juice in the
bottle when it should.

Earlier this week I was talking to my friend John about his trip to
California and the wines he and his girlfriend tried.  Having been
to Sonoma earlier this year, it was nice to compare notes and hear
about different wineries.
</p>

<p>
Being in Michigan, and being True to the Mitten (even if the bottom
right cuff
is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/us/detroit-files-for-bankruptcy.html">a
bit frayed</a>), we got on the topic of Michigan wines.
</p>

<p>
I'm quite fond of sparkling wine, and was talking to John about the
<a href="http://www.lmawby.com/">Mawby</a> wines from Northern Michigan and our most excellent experience
at <a href="http://www.domainecarneros.com/">Domaine Carneros</a> in Sonoma.
</p>

<p>
While I've never been to the Northern Michigan wineries, despite
having lived just north of them for 15 years, John has been.  He
mentioned that he really enjoyed the Two Lads sparkling Pinot Grigio
and that it was available in Ann Arbor at a few places (<a href="http://www.producestation.com/">The Produce
Station</a> and <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/annarbor">Whole Foods</a>, among others).

Happily for me, my aunt works at The Produce Station, so I emailed
her to see if they had the 2 Lads Sparkling Pinot Grigio in stock.

Yes, we have sparkling pinot grigio! gail

<p>
Success!
</p>

<p>
After work I went to The Produce Station and picked up some proper
food and three bottles of wine.  The bottles are quite pretty.
</p>

<p>
As a brief but relevant aside, it was very hot out&#x2014;more than
90F&#x2014;and my car was in the sun all day.
</p>

<p>
After loading my cherry tomatoes and baby carrots and sparkling wine
into the car, I headed home, looking forward to dinner and sharing
a glass of wine with my wife.
</p>

<p>
The distance, according to Google Maps, between The Produce Station
and my house is 3.1 miles.  As it turns out, a fateful 3.1 miles.
</p>

<p>
At about 2 miles, after 6 turns, I heard from the back of my station
wagon the very upsetting sound <i>Pft! Shhhhhhhhhh!</i>.  Crap.  One of
the bottles had done something bad.  But the bottle and its badness
were in the way back, and all I could tell was that the windows were
dry and there was no Bellagio-style fountain show evident in the
rear-view mirror.  So that was promising.  And the sparkling did
smell pretty good, which was also promising.
</p>

<p>
Being a mere mile from home, I made the call to leave the other two
(sealed) bottles back there, avoid pot-holes, and try to make it
home.  Also, I was in denial about the state of the back of my car.
</p>

<p>
<i>Pft! Shhhhhhhhhh!</i>.
</p>

<p>
Crap.
</p>

</div>

<p>
I pulled over.  I was not going to lose three bottles of wine in
3.1 miles.  That's just mad.
</p>

<p>
The two bottles that burst hadn't really burst&#x2014;the caps were
still on and 80% of the wine that 2 Lads had put in the bottles was
still there, leaving about 1/2 a bottle of sparkling wine in the
back of my car, but even so&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I took all three bottles from the way-back and put them on the
floor of the passenger's side and kept a close eye on them on the
way home.  Little bastards.  Seriously, would a cork have killed
you?
</p>

<p>
This is where the French, regardless of what you think of the rest
of the country, has their heads on right.  If it's carbonated, and
pressurized, and delicious, take some damn care.  Like using a cork,
and not just any cork, but a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/magazine/who-made-that-champagne-cork.html">special cork</a>, which is then further
controlled with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muselet">muselet</a>, that wire thing that adds all of the
drama to opening a bottle of sparkling wine until the pop of the
cork, which then steals the show.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_cork">crown cork</a> is neither a crown nor a cork nor unsuitable for
sparkling wine.  2 Lads, please, a cork and muselet.  For the love
of God and the back of my car and your delicious wine seal those
bottles properly.

<h2 id="sec-3">Yes, but the wine! How is the wine!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The sealed bottle got a place of honor among the Mawby and Domain
Carneros bottles in the basement refrigerator; the other two were
in the upstairs refrigerator, at risk of being consumed.  But
wait&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
These bottles are tall.  Really tall.  Impractically tall.
</p>

<p>
I had to rearrange those door-shelf things so they would fit; they
weren't going on their sides after the little demonstration in the
back of my car.  Fool me once, shame on you; waste even more wine,
shame on me.
</p>

<p>
After they were chilled, we opened the one with the least wine in
it.
</p>

<p>
Thumbs up.
</p>

<p>
It's a flavorful, dry sparkling that is very drinkable.  It is
another Michigan sparkling wine success that has established its
place in my rotation of Michigan sparklers.  Mawby, you still own
the price/performance, but watch out, these Lads have a good thing
going.
</p>

<p>
Now I really wish that missing 1/2 bottle wasn't soaked into the
way-back of my car.
